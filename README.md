# Project 3 - Yelp

Yelp is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
1. Implement a working search bar to find restaurants directly

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How do you access the API via search bar to get results?
2. How do you implement the map view of yelp?

## Notes

Implementing the correct constraints was a bit of an issue, but worked out well for all devices in the end.
